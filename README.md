[![Java CI with Maven](https://github.com/hottek/ase/actions/workflows/maven.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/hottek/ase/actions/workflows/maven.yml)
- Build using Maven
- Uses Java 16

## Usage
Make sure Maven and Java is installed on your system.  
`$ build-windows.sh` produces an executable jar (ase-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar) file in the `/target`-folder.  
If you get a Maven compile error, make sure you have set the JAVA_HOME variable to the folder which contains the JDK16.
